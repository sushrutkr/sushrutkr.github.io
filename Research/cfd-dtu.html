            The Computational Fluid Dynamics Group is based out of Delhi Technological University. Delhi and includes academics, industry professionals, and students who perform CFD simulations on problems spanning a wide range of fields. Through an innovative and interdisciplinary approach, we aim to apply the fundamentals of fluid mechanics and thermal engineering to practical situations and come up with pragmatic solutions through computational tools. Prof. B.B Arora is the Principal Investigator of the Lab.

                    <b>Computational Evaluation of a Novel Aerodynamic Road Vehicle Design and Drag Reduction using Vortex Generators</b><br><br>

                    Drag is a phenomenon where a low-pressure area is created behind a moving body in a fluid due to flow separation. Not only does drag reduction help in attaining higher top speeds but, more importantly, also in economizing fuel usage. Lower values of coefficient of drag give us better design for fuel economy. Fuel economy is important because, in a modern world where most machines are run directly on fossil fuels or energy generated by the combustion of fossil fuels, the preservation of these fuels is important, and the pollution caused by burning or spilling of these fuels have a severe negative effect on the surroundings and our atmosphere overall. For any general body, Reynolds Number is used to predict where the transition from streamlined to turbulent flow will occur and where the laminar boundary layer becomes a turbulent boundary layer. These results help to identify where the separation of flow will take place, and vortex generators can be used to delay this so as to reduce the effect pressure drag being created. Vortex generators create strong tip vortices that energize the boundary layer and therefore help in keeping the flow attached. In the proposed experiment, the aim is to design and evaluate a specific vortex generator that can be used in an airfoil or hydrofoil in the same way to give the same result of drag reduction.

                    The industrial consultancy project was aimed at the installation of submersible pumps inside the existing sump in a way they don’t interfere with the working of old centrifugal pumps. Regions of turbulence were identified, and the location for new pumps was suggested to increase the water supply to meet the city’s growing demand. The first phase of the project was to prepare the CAD models of Centrifugal Pumps and Sump, and for this, SolidWorks was used. The second phase involves the design validation of the CAD model, and for this, the Centrifugal Pumps were simulated using ANSYS Fluent using the sliding mesh approach, and the results were then compared with the performance characteristics provided by the manufacturer. In the third phase, whole water network Reservoir's sump, puddle pipes, main sump, centrifugal pumps were simulated and to account for multiphase (Air & Water) Volume of Fluid model was used, and the possible locations for new submersible pumps were suggested so that they don't interfere with old centrifugal pumps and don't cause issues like suction cavitation.
